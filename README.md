🧰 Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
Then install dependencies with:

Object-Oriented Design:
Classes for Player, Zombie, Bullet, and Camera ensure modular structure.

Smart Spawning System:
Zombies spawn outside the player’s view range, creating a true open-world experience.

Procedural Map Generation:
Each run generates unique obstacles and pickups.

Wave Management:
Difficulty scales automatically based on wave progression.

Scoring System

+10 points for regular zombies

+15 or +20 for tougher types

Waves increase zombie spawn count exponentially

Planned Improvements

 Add sound effects and background music

 Implement zombie pathfinding around obstacles

 Add weapon upgrade or shop system

 Multiplayer (LAN co-op mode)

 Add boss waves
